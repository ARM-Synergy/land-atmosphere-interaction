## Group Members

Our guiding questions:
-energy balance closure at each site

-biosphere â†” atmosphere state relationship

-seasonal to internal variability of atmosphere on aerosol production (new particle formation)

-cloud formation/ ecosystem dynamics

-ecosystem dynamics

-distributed flux (LE/H) in region for LES simulations
