# Land Atmosphere Interaction

Land atmosphere interactions group from the 2025 ARM Summer School.

## Group Members

Our guiding questions:

-energy balance closure at each site (S20, S30, S40, M1)

-biosphere ↔ atmosphere state relationship

-seasonal to internal variability of atmosphere on aerosol production (new particle formation)

-cloud formation/ ecosystem dynamics

-ecosystem dynamics

-distributed flux (LE/H) in region for LES simulations
